# Keypad--Multiplexing
scan  the  4x4  keypad  and  transmit  the  corresponding ASCII character using the USART.Your program is intended to output the letter or the number that is pushed on the sixteen button keypad provided to you, based on which key is being pressed. The suggestion is that you set rows as output and columns as input. Thecode shall first set all rows  high  at  each  pass  and  then, go  one  row  at  a  time(setting  them  low),  checking  each column  in  that  row,  to  identify  which  button  is  pressed.  And  then  interpret  the  pressed  button based  on  the  pins  each  key  is  associated  with,  and  output  the  keyâ€™s  corresponding letter/number/symbol  on  theData  Visualizerconsoleprovided  in  the  Atmel  Studio.  The  codeshould run on an infinite loop, continually scanning for any button that is pushed.
